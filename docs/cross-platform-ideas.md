# Cross-Platform Expansion Strategy with Expo

This document outlines the technical feasibility and strategy for expanding the Echo application to platforms beyond iOS and the Web, leveraging our existing Expo + Tamagui codebase.

## 1. Android (Phone & Tablet)
**Status: ✅ Native Support**

Expo builds standard Android apps by default. Our current codebase works out-of-the-box on Android.
- **Action**: No changes required. Continue building features.
- **Testing**: Can run `npm run android` to test on an emulator or device.

## 2. Apple TV (tvOS) & Android TV
**Status: ⚠️ Possible (via Forks)**

React Native and Expo can target TV platforms, but it requires using a specific fork called **React Native TVOS**.

- **Technical Approach**:
  - Use Expo Config Plugins (`@react-native-tvos/config-tv`) to swap the standard React Native engine for the TV-specific engine during the prebuild phase.
  - **Code Sharing**: ~95% of logic (API layer, state management, utilities) is shared.
  - **UI Differences**: TV apps require focus-based navigation (D-pad) instead of touch events. We would need to handle `onFocus` states on our `GlassyCard` and `GlassyButton` components.

## 3. macOS
**Status: ⚠️ Possible (via `react-native-macos`)**

Similar to TVOS, Microsoft maintains a fork called `react-native-macos` that allows React Native to target macOS desktop.

- **Technical Approach**:
  - Compiles to a native macOS `.app` (not Catalyst, though Catalyst is another option via pure Expo).
  - Requires **Expo Prebuild** (CNG) to generate the native macOS project.
  - **Tamagui Advantage**: Tamagui puts us in a strong position here because its styling engine supports mouse/hover interactions (`$platform-web`) which translate well to desktop apps.

## 4. watchOS (Apple Watch)
**Status: ❌ Native Code Required (No React Native)**

React Native **does not** run on the Apple Watch due to hardware constraints preventing the full JavaScript engine from running efficiently.

- **Technical Approach**:
  - **Native Extension**: We must add a native watchOS extension to the Xcode project generated by Expo Prebuild.
  - **Language**: This part of the app MUST be written in **Swift & SwiftUI**.
  - **Data Integration**: The React Native phone app communicates with the Watch app using `WCSession` (Watch Connectivity). We can send auth tokens and cached data from the phone to the watch.
  - **Strategy**: Keep the Watch app extremely simple (e.g., "View Balance", "Quick Add Transaction").

## Summary Matrix

| Platform | Difficulty | Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Android** | Very Easy | Built-in |
| **Apple TV** | Medium | Config Plugin + RN Fork |
| **macOS** | Medium | Config Plugin + RN Fork |
| **watchOS** | Hard | **Native Swift Required** (Extension) |
